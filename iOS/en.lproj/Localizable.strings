After​ that,​ a​ calendar​ will​ open,​ showing​ all​ available​ appointments​ for​ the​ service​ he requested,​ depending​ on​ the​ time​ of​ service​ that​ the​ business​ determined.​ When clicking​ on​ one​ of​ the​ available​ appointments​ a​ screen​ will​ appear​ with​ all​ the​ details of​ the​ desired​ appointment,​ and​ by​ clicking​ on​ the​ 'confirm'​ button​ the​ appointment will​ be​ schedule​ in​ the​ business's​ and​ the​ customer's​ calendar.";
